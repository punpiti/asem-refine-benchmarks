"""Full Phase-1 experimental grid for the external tool NOVOPlasty, matching
baseline 1/2/3's grid design exactly (all ordered pairs x depths 1-8X x 3
replicates, same stable_seed formula) so the three ASEM/ECTI-CON baselines
and NOVOPlasty are directly, read-for-read comparable.

NOVOPlasty is a real subprocess (not pure-Python), so each job is much more
expensive than the internal baselines (~minutes, not milliseconds) and can
fail outright on divergent references at low depth -- failures are recorded
as a row with error info rather than crashing the grid.

Outputs (in scripts/refine_reference/results/ext_novoplasty/):
  - grid_results.csv : one row per (pair, depth, replicate); failed jobs get
                        f1=NaN and an "error" column populated.

Resumable: grid_results.csv is appended to as each job finishes, and is read
back on startup to skip already-completed jobs (same pattern as
run_grid_baseline3.py).
