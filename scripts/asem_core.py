"""Shared EM loop for the ASEM family of baselines (IEEE Access and OJEMB --
see ``.ai/ECTI_CON_TRANSLOCATION_TECHNIQUE.md`` for why these two are called
"ASEM" as a pair, distinct from ECTI-CON's unrelated LCS/splitting method).

The two baselines differ only in how a single read is turned into zero or
more accepted local alignments (IEEE Access: one alignment or none; OJEMB:
also recursively re-aligns the unaligned flanks of a read, so one read can
contribute several disjoint sub-alignments -- see baseline_ojemb.py). Every
other part of the algorithm (position/symbol tallying, the match-state-only
consensus rule, the iterate-until-stable loop) is identical between them and
lives here once.
