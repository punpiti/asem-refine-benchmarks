"""Hybrid ASEM: reference-guided EM plus a local de novo gap-fill step.

Reference-guided placement (asem_core.py) leaves a genome's most divergent
regions untouched -- no read ever clears the alignment threshold there, so
those positions keep whatever base theta started with, forever (see the
untouched-island analysis in .ai/PROJECT_STATE.md: at the hardest tested
pair, 65.2% of the reference is never touched by a single placed read).
But the reads that *originate* from those regions still overlap each other
exactly even when none of them overlaps theta, because they all come from
the same real target sequence.

This module adds one step to every EM iteration: assemble the pool of
reads that fail placement this round plus placed reads immediately adjacent
to a long zero-depth island via read-read overlap, then try to anchor each
resulting contig back onto theta with the same score-threshold rule used for
reads. The boundary reads are selected from their accepted reference
coordinates; the overlap assembler itself still decides sequence joins. An anchored
contig is fed into the same position/symbol vote-counting machinery as an
ordinary read (asem_core.accumulate_alignment), so a well-supported contig
can pull a previously-untouched span of theta straight to the true
sequence in one shot. Because next iteration's E-step re-aligns every
read -- including previously-unplaced ones -- against the patched theta,
reads that couldn't place before may now clear the threshold near a
contig's edges, shrinking the unplaced pool and letting contigs grow
further each round.

Validated on the single hardest-pair island before writing this: the 109
reads whose true origin fell in the largest untouched island assembled
into 2 contigs (1290bp + 781bp), both 100% identical to the true target
over their full length.

    long, reasonably-identical anchor window.

    This deliberately does NOT reuse the read-level tau/length rule (score
    >= tau * MATCH_SCORE * len(contig)). Empirically, contigs assembled
    from an unplaced-read pool anchor to theta at ~73-80% identity over
    their *aligned span* -- exactly the divergence level that made the
    underlying 150bp reads fail the read-level threshold in the first
    place -- and parasail's local alignment often can't sustain that rate
    across a contig's full length, so it returns the best-scoring
    *sub*-window rather than an end-to-end match. Judging that against a
    bar sized for the whole contig punishes exactly the long, high-value
    contigs this step exists to anchor.

    contig_tau=0.25 is a score-normalized threshold, not identity
    directly: with this scoring scheme (match=+2, mismatch=-3, no gaps),
    score >= contig_tau * MATCH_SCORE * L works out to an identity floor
    of exactly 70% (solve 2p - 3(1-p) >= 0.5 for p). min_anchor_len=300
    is an additional, independent floor on top of that -- NOT because
    70%-identity matches are common at 150bp against random sequence
    (they aren't: a purely-random-DNA negative control, contigs generated
    from `random.choice('ACGT')` with no relation to theta, produced 0
    false anchors in 2000 trials at each of the 150bp and 300bp length
    floors, so contig_tau=0.25 alone already rejects unrelated sequence
    reliably against that null model). The 300bp floor is a margin against
    a different, untested risk: real non-homologous genomic sequence is
    not perfectly uniform-random (GC bias, low-complexity/repetitive
    stretches), which could in principle score better against theta than
    the idealized random-DNA control above. This margin has not been
    validated against structured/repeat-containing negative controls --
    flagged here as an open gap, not a confirmed safety property.
