"""Testable helper implementation for boundary-recruited ASEM-Hybrid.

This module implements the boundary-recruited variant independently for
focused tests.  When a zero-depth island
is detected, the assembly pool contains the unplaced reads plus only placed
reads whose reference alignment overlaps a short flank immediately beside an
island.  The placed reads supply a coordinate-linked bridge at each boundary;
they are *not* drawn from the whole reference.

No read-end labels are inferred from sequence.  Membership in a left or right
flank is determined from the accepted alignment's reference coordinates;
the overlap-layout assembler then determines compatible suffix--prefix joins
from the read sequences themselves.  The paper's reported unplaced-only
algorithm remains available by passing ``boundary_flank=None`` to
``asem_hybrid.run_asem_hybrid_loop``.
